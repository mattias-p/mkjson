# mkjson â€“ Command-Line JSON Composer

`mkjson` accepts specifications in a shell friendly syntax, and constructs and prints the
corresponding JSON value.

The range of successful outputs from `mkjson` is exactly the set of valid JSON texts (per
[RFC 8259]) with minimized whitespace and sorted object keys.
