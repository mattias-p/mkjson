# JSON Construction Toolkit

This repository hosts `mkjson` and `mkjsonrpc` â€” command-line utilities for constructing
structured JSON and JSON-RPC messages.

## Overview

These tools use a shared path-based directive syntax to generate structured data in a
concise and programmable way.

 * [`mkjson`]: Compose arbitrary JSON structures.
 * [`mkjsonrpc`]: Compose JSON-RPC 2.0 requests.
 * [Directive Syntax]: Reference for the shared directive-based structure.
 * [Design Rationale]: Explanation of the motivation and design rationale.
